Hello! Digital-Human-X was born out of the Challenge Cup, and was developed by [Dr. Zhou Yingjie](https://github.com/zyj-2000) under the guidance of [Professor Zhang Lin](https://faculty-cumt-edu-cn-s.webvpn.cumt.edu.cn:8118/ZL123456789101112131415161718/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Associate Professor Liu Hui](https://faculty.cumt.edu.cn/LH12345678910111213/zh_CN/index.htm). We will introduce the follow-up progress here, and we will recruit interested friends to join the follow-up development from time to time, so stay tuned!
